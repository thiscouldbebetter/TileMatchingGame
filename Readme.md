TileMatchingGame
================

The code in this repository implements a simple tile-matching game in TypeScript.


Running
-------
To run the game, open the file Source/TileMatchingGame.html in a web browser that runs JavaScript.


Building
--------

To build, make sure TypeScript is installed and run the command "tsc" from within the Source directory.  Note that, since the transpiled .js files are included in the repository, it should be unnecessary to build to play the game with no modifications.
